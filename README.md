# Naveed Ahmed Syed — Portfolio

This repository contains my personal software engineering portfolio, built with **Next.js (App Router)** and **React**. The design is intentionally minimal and resume‑like: dark, focused, and centered on the work rather than visual noise.

## About this site

The home page introduces who I am and what I work on. A concise hero section highlights:

- Name and role: **Software Engineer**
- Location: **Toronto, ON**
- Core languages: **C++**, **Python**, **Swift**, **JavaScript**

From there, visitors can quickly download a PDF résumé or scroll into sections that mirror a modern CV: skills, experience, projects, and contact.

## Skills

The skills section is compact and text‑first so it’s easy to scan:

- **Languages:** C, C++, Python, Swift, JavaScript, TypeScript  
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** React, Next.js, Express.js, Flask, TensorFlow, scikit‑learn, pandas, OpenCV  

The goal is to make it obvious which stacks I’m productive in, without clicking into multiple pages.

## Experience

Work experience is presented as a simple timeline:

- Clear **company**, **title**, **dates**, and **employment type**
- Impact‑focused bullet points that highlight:
  - Automation and test coverage
  - Performance improvements
  - Reliability and production stability
  - Shipping features in real products

This makes it easy for recruiters and engineers to understand how I contribute on real teams.

## Projects

Projects are grouped into categories:

- **AI / ML & Computer Vision**
- **Automation & Tooling**
- **Application Development**
- **Full‑Stack Web Development**
- **Open Source**

Each project card shows a title, tag, tech stack, and links to a technical deep dive (where applicable) and the source code. Example projects:

- Self‑driving car behavioral cloning simulator  
- Real‑time smile detection pipeline  
- SSH login automation tools  
- Contributions to **Vital Box** and **Visual Studio Code**

## Contact

A minimal contact footer exposes the essentials:

- Email: **syednaveed2006@gmail.com**
- Links to **GitHub** and **LinkedIn**

This repo is a snapshot of how I design, implement, and communicate my work as a software engineer.
